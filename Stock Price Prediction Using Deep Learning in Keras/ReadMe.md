My first article is on: Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM-RNN in Keras (Expected Submission Date: 20th November, 2017)

It will cover following ideas:

- Introduction on Stock Price, source of data, importance of Stock Prediction in Finance and Economics.
- Time-series data, introduction to the dataset and OHLC average
- Loading modules, importing data and Data Preprocessing: cleaning, normalizing
- Building deep learning model (LSTM-RNN) in Keras
- Trainig
- Test and Accuracy
- Conclusion and learning outcomes
